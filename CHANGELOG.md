# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `POST /recommend` — recommendation engine that assembles a personalised cosmetic bag from the quiz result.
  Accepts `budget` (low / mid / high), `concerns`, `vegan`, `cruelty_free`, `minimalism`, `allergens`.
  Returns an ordered `bag` of products with `meta.total_price_rub`.
- Per-step segment fallback: each routine step is matched against the user's own budget segment first; if that
  segment has no candidate for the step, the engine falls back to the nearest segment via the explicit
  `SEGMENT_PRIORITY` table (`low → mid → high`, `mid → low → high`, `high → mid → low`). Hard filters
  (vegan, cruelty-free, allergens) are applied before the segment search and are never relaxed by the fallback.
  Substituted steps are reported in `meta.note` ("Шаги без точного совпадения по бюджету: …").

### Changed

- `POST /recommend` request schema: replaced `segment` filter with `budget` + `concerns` + `minimalism` fields.
- `ProductOut` response model: exposes `main_actives_short` and `concerns_addressed`; hides `allergens_norm` and other internal fields.
- `BagItem` no longer contains `routine_step` or `order_index` — those fields live in `BagItem.product` (`ProductOut`) only, eliminating duplicate keys in the response.
- Dockerfile `CMD` updated to `${PORT:-8000}` for Railway `$PORT` compatibility.

### Added

- `justification` block in each `BagItem`: `role` (localised step name + index), `what_it_does` (up to 3 phrases from `functional_category`), `key_actives` (up to 3 from `main_actives_short`), `why_for_you` (matched concern phrases + vegan/CF/allergen flags).
- `frequency` field in `ProductOut`: human-readable usage frequency in Russian (e.g. "Ежедневно", "2–3 раза в неделю").
- `image_url` (nullable) in `Product` and `ProductOut`.
- `empty_steps` list in `meta`: core steps with zero candidates in any segment, after hard filters.
- `db/seeds/patch_image_url.py` — idempotent script for manually patching `image_url` per product ID. Dry-runs when `IMAGE_URLS` dict is empty.
